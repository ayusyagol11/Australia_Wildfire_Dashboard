# üåè Australia Wildfire Dashboard

![Dashboard Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400) *(Replace with an actual screenshot of your dashboard)*

Welcome to the **Australia Wildfire Dashboard**! This interactive web application provides insights into historical wildfire data across different regions of Australia. Built with **Dash** and **Plotly**, the dashboard allows users to explore wildfire trends, analyze fire intensity, and visualize key metrics over time.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Filters**:
  - Select a **region** (e.g., New South Wales, Queensland).
  - Choose a **year** to analyze wildfire data.
  
- **Visualizations**:
  - **Pie Chart**: Monthly average estimated fire area.
  - **Bar Chart**: Monthly average count of fire pixels.
  - **Line Chart**: Mean fire brightness over time.
  - **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between fire radiative power and brightness.

- **Insights**:
  - Identify months with the largest fire areas.
  - Track fire intensity and frequency over time.
  - Explore correlations between fire brightness and radiative power.

## üìä Dataset

The dashboard uses the **Historical Wildfires Dataset**, which includes the following key columns:

| Column Name                     | Description                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Region`                        | Australian region where the fire occurred.       |
| `Date`                          | Date of the fire event.                          |
| `Estimated_fire_area`           | Estimated area affected by the fire (in hectares).|
| `Mean_estimated_fire_brightness`| Average brightness of the fire.                  |
| `Mean_estimated_fire_radiative_power` | Average radiative power of the fire.        |
| `Count`                         | Number of fire pixels detected.                  |

üìà Visualisations
1. Monthly Average Estimated Fire Area (Pie Chart)
Pie Chart (Replace with actual image)

Shows the distribution of fire area by month.

Helps identify months with the largest fire areas.

2. Monthly Average Count of Fire Pixels (Bar Chart)
Bar Chart (Replace with actual image)

Displays the frequency of fire pixels by month.

Indicates how often fires occurred in each month.

3. Mean Fire Brightness Over Time (Line Chart)
Line Chart (Replace with actual image)

Tracks the average fire brightness over time.

Higher values indicate more intense fires.

4. Fire Radiative Power vs. Brightness (Scatter Plot)
Scatter Plot (Replace with actual image)

Explores the relationship between fire radiative power and brightness.

Larger and darker points represent fires with higher area and count.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
